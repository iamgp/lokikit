# Python Development Workflow

This document outlines the critical development practices and tooling requirements for this project.

## Environment Setup

- **Installation**: This project is intended to be used via `uv tools install X`, but can be developed using `uv`.
- **Virtual Environment**: A virtual environment must be used with `uv`.
  - This is typically already created, but check if package-related errors occur.
  - To create a new virtual environment: `uv venv`
  - To activate: `source .venv/bin/activate` (Unix) or `.venv\Scripts\activate` (Windows)

## Package Management

- **Adding Dependencies**: Packages MUST be added using `uv add X`
  - For development dependencies: `uv add --dev X`
  - Consider using dependency groups when appropriate: `uv add --group [group_name] X`
- **Updating Dependencies**: Use `uv pip compile` to update dependency lockfiles

## Development Workflow

1. **Starting a New Task**:
   - Update your local repository: `git pull`
   - Create a new branch: `git checkout -b feat/feature-name` or `git checkout -b fix/bug-name`
   - Ensure dependencies are up-to-date: `uv pip sync`

2. **During Development**:
   - Commit often when sub-tasks are complete
   - Use conventional commits:
     ```
     feat: add user authentication
     fix: resolve dependency conflict
     docs: update installation instructions
     test: add tests for user service
     refactor: improve error handling logic
     chore: update dev dependencies
     ```

3. **Before Committing**:
   - Run linters, type checking, and tests:
     ```
     ruff check .
     basedpyright
     pytest
     ```
   - All checks MUST pass with no errors
   - Fix any issues before proceeding

## Code Quality Enforcement

- **Linting**: All code must pass `ruff check .` without errors
- **Type Checking**: All code must pass `basedpyright` without errors
- **Testing**: All tests must pass with `pytest`
  - No tests should be skipped or disabled without documented reason
  - New features must include appropriate test coverage
